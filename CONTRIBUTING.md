## Getting Started

To contribute to React-Framify, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your work (see [Issue Types and Branch Naming](#issue-types-and-branch-naming) for branch naming conventions).
4. Make your changes.
5. Push your branch to your forked repository.
6. Submit a pull request.

## Issue Types and Branch Naming

When creating an issue, please select the appropriate issue type:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Efficiency & Performance
- ‚ú® Feature Request
- üêõ Bug Report & ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Vulnerability
- üìù Documentation
- ü§î Support or Usage Questions

### Automated Branch Creation

We have a workflow that automatically creates branches based on the issue type and title. The branch name format is:

```bash
${type of issue}/REACT-FRAMIFY-${sanitizedIssueTitle}
```

**Examples:**

- For a feature request titled "Add dark mode", the branch name would be: `feature-request/REACT-FRAMIFY-add-dark-mode`.

- For a bug report titled "Fix memory leak", the branch name would be: `bug-report/REACT-FRAMIFY-fix-memory-leak`.

**Note:** If the branch is not automatically created or you are manually creating a branch, please follow this naming convention.
