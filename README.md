## Installation

Get started with React-Framify in no time:

```bash
npm install react-framify
```

## Usage

Dive right in with this simple example of how to use the PhoneFrame component in your React application:

```jsx
import PhoneFrame from 'react-framify';

export default function MyApp() {
  const screenshotList = [
  'screenshot1.png',
  'screenshot2.png',
  'screenshot3.png',
];

  return (
    <>
      <PhoneFrame screenshotList={screenshotList} />;
    </>
  )
}
```

### Using with Next.js

If you're incorporating React-Framify into a Next.js project, you'll need to handle images a bit differently due to Next.js's image optimization features. Here's how you can do it:

```tsx
"use client"

import PhoneFrame from "react-framify";
// Import your images as StaticImageData
import FrameSetSSOne from "../../../public/img-1.png";
import FrameSetSSTwo from "../../../public/img-2.png";
import FrameSetSSThree from "../../../public/img-3.png";
import FrameSetSSFour from "../../../public/img-4.png";

export default function MyApp() {
  // Use the .src attribute of imported images for the screenshotList
  const screenshotList = [
    FrameSetSSOne.src,
    FrameSetSSTwo.src,
    FrameSetSSThree.src,
    FrameSetSSFour.src
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <PhoneFrame screenshotList={screenshotList} />;
    </>
  )
}
```
